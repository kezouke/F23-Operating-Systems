The 2008 BMW M3 (E92) is the fourth generation BMW M3, replacing the E46 M3 in 2007.

The E92 is powered by a 4.0 litre V8 engine derived from the V10 engine used by the E63 M6 and E60 M5. It reuses an optimised variant of the E46's limited-slip differential that is capable of 100% lockup. It also had various weight saving techniques applied, including a carbon fibre roof, and introduced a 7-speed M-DCT dual-clutch automatic transmission.

The E90 series M3 was the first in the M3 range to have separate codenames depending on the models, with E90 designating the saloon, E92 for the coupé, and E93 for the convertible variant. The E92 also competed in motorsports as the GT2.

In 2010, a limited production track-oriented model - the GTS - was produced. In 2011, the M3 E92 received minor exterior updates including LED taillights.

The E92 M3 became the last coupé in the M3 line-up as BMW designated the 3-Series coupé and convertible range as the 4-Series for the following generation, making the M4 F82 its direct successor.
