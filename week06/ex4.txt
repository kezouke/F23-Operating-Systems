Round-Robin (RR) Algorithm Output:

Quantum (time slice) specified by the user: 2 seconds.
Processes are scheduled in a circular manner, and each process is given a fixed quantum to execute before moving to the next one.
The number of triangular numbers found by each process is recorded and printed.
Now, let's compare the Round-Robin output with the FCFS and SJF outputs:

Waiting Time (WT):

Round-Robin (RR): The waiting time for each process in the RR algorithm is relatively balanced since each process is given a time slice in a cyclic manner. This balance minimizes extreme cases but doesn't necessarily minimize waiting time.
FCFS: Waiting time in FCFS can be significant for later-arriving processes, as they need to wait for earlier processes to complete.
SJF: SJF usually results in the lowest waiting times, as it prioritizes shorter jobs.

Turnaround Time (TAT):

RR: Turnaround time in RR can be a bit higher compared to SJF but is generally better than FCFS for a mix of long and short processes.
FCFS: FCFS may have higher turnaround times because longer processes arriving early can delay the completion of shorter ones.
SJF: SJF tends to minimize turnaround times by executing shorter processes first.

Response Time (RT):

RR: RR offers decent response times since each process is given an initial slice of the quantum.
FCFS: FCFS may have a longer response time, as the first process arriving may not be the quickest to execute.
SJF: SJF typically has the shortest response times as it starts with the shortest job.


The choice of scheduling algorithm should be based on the specific requirements of the system and the desired trade-offs between fairness and efficiency.
When comparing these scheduling algorithms, consider the specific workload and priorities of the system to determine which one is the most appropriate.
