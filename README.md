### [03.Comprehensive_recap_of_C_2.0](03.Comprehensive_recap_of_C_2.0)
Advanced C programming exercises covering pointers, structures, file manipulation, directory organization, array aggregation, and mathematical computations. The [tasks_description.pdf](03.Comprehensive_recap_of_C_2.0/tasks_description.pdf) file provides detailed task descriptions.

### [04.Processes_&_Threads](04.Processes_&_Threads)
Programming exercises related to process creation, vector calculations, process observation, and the development of a simplistic shell. [tasks_description.pdf](04.Processes_&_Threads/tasks_description.pdf) offers comprehensive guidance for each exercise.

### [05.Interprocess_Communication](05.Interprocess_Communication)
This series explores tasks related to interprocess communication via pipes, multi-threading, and parallelizing primality checking. Detailed explanations for each exercise can be found in the [tasks_description.pdf](05.Interprocess_Communication/tasks_description.pdf) file.

### [06.Processes_scheduling](06.Processes_scheduling)
Exercises covering process and signal handling, scheduling algorithms, and simulation. The [tasks_description.pdf](06.Processes_scheduling/tasks_description.pdf) file provides detailed guidance for each task.

### [07.Memory_Management](07.Memory_Management)
Tasks covering memory allocation simulation and file processing using memory mapping. The exploration includes memory allocation algorithms, file processing, and system calls. Refer to [tasks_description.pdf](07.Memory_Management/tasks_description.pdf) for detailed task descriptions.

### [08.Memory_Management_2.0](08.Memory_Management_2.0)
Extensions of memory management exercises covering Tribonacci calculations, Euclidean distance computation, file system simulation, and array aggregation. [tasks_description.pdf](08.Memory_Management_2.0/tasks_description.pdf) provides detailed task descriptions.

### [09.Memory_Management_3.0](09.Memory_Management_3.0)
Advanced memory management tasks covering password generation, hacking simulation, virtual memory simulation, and memory usage monitoring. Refer to [tasks_description.pdf](09.Memory_Management_3.0/tasks_description.pdf) for detailed guidance.

### [10.File_Systems](10.File_Systems)
Exploration of file system operations, directory monitoring, file type analysis, inode, and link examination, symbolic links, and file permissions. [tasks_description.pdf](10.File_Systems/tasks_description.pdf) offers detailed explanations for each exercise.

### [11.Alternative_File_Systems](11.Alternative_File_Systems)
Introduction to File System isolation using chroot, involving setting up a Loop File System and isolating processes within it. [tasks_description.pdf](11.Alternative_File_Systems/tasks_description.pdf) provides comprehensive guidance.

### [12.Input_&_Output](12.Input_&_Output)
Capturing keyboard events in C programming, involving the creation of a program to capture keyboard events directly from the device and print them to stdout. [tasks_description.pdf](12.Input_&_Output/tasks_description.pdf) provides detailed explanations.

### [13.Deadlocks](13.Deadlocks)
Tasks related to deadlock detection and avoidance using various algorithms. Programs cover resource allocation with deadlock detection and the application of Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance. Detailed explanations for each exercise can be found in the [tasks_description.pdf](13.Deadlocks/tasks_description.pdf) file.
