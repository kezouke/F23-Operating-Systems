FINDINGS:
1) With Changing the Root Directory:
The output reflects the contents of the chrooted environment starting from the root (/) within the LOFS.
It includes directories like bin, lib, lib64, file1, file2, etc., which are part of the new root directory.

2) Without Changing the Root Directory:
The output reflects the contents of the actual root directory of the system.
It includes typical system directories like bin, lib, lib64, home, var, etc, etc., which are not part of the chrooted environment.

3) Key Findings:
  a) Difference Explanation: 
    This difference is because the chroot command changes the perceived root directory for the current running process and its children. A program       that is run in such a modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that environmental directory tree. This modified environment     is called a chroot jail. Changing the root directory is commonly done for system maintenance, such as recovering from a system crash, and for        computer security, such as running internet-facing services in a chroot jail.

  b) Chrooted Environment Output: The first case shows only the contents of the chrooted environment, isolating the process to a specific directory      (./lofsdisk). This allows the execution of a program (ex1) with a modified root directory.

  c) System Root Output: The second case reflects the actual system root directory, showing a broader view of the system's file structure.

In summary, the primary difference lies in the scope of the file system hierarchy that the program (ex1) can access and interact with. The chrooted environment constrains the view to a specific directory, while running without changing the root directory gives access to the entire system's root.
